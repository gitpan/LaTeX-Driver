"How can I stop getting FAIL reports for missing libraries or other non-Perl dependencies?"

If you have some special dependencies and don't want to get CPAN Testers reports if a dependency is not available, just exit from the Makefile.PL or Build.PL normally (with an exit code of 0) before the Makefile or Build file is created.

exit 0 unless some_dependency_is_met();


requires dvitype for testing
